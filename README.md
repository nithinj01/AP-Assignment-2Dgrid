Given a 2D grid of cells with obstacles and passages.
Write an algorithm which finds the shortest path from a cell A in the grid to a cell B in the grid, while only moving up, down, left or right through cells with passages. Log the route description to the console when done or an error message if no way was found. The grid should be represented as 2D list of booleans.
Think about test cases and write unit tests to verify your good works properly.



A represents ‘source’ 
B represents ‘destination’ 
# represents cell you can travel 
0 represents cell you can not travel
